                          Multimodal brain imaging is a promising and
                          recent approach to study the function and
                          structure of the brain by collecting multiple
                          types of data from the same individual using
                          various imaging techniques (fMRI, fNIRS, MRI,
                          DTI, EEG, etc.). This allows the examination
                          of complex brain functions and diseases from
                          different imaging techniques, which can yield
                          important insights that are only partially
                          detected by each modality. At the same time,
                          however, the advent of multimodal neuroimaging
                          has brought the urgent need to develop new
                          data integration methods that can capitalize
                          on the strength of each modality and make full
                          usage of the data dimensionality and
                          informational complexity<br>
                          <br>
                          In one of our projects, we utilized single and
                          multimodal brain imaging data including MRI,
                          DTI, and rs‐fMRI from a large data set with
                          839 subjects to predict brain age. We
                          evaluated the prediction performance of 36
                          different combinations of imaging features and
                          ML models including deep learning. We showed
                          that multimodal brain imaging features derived
                          from MRI, DTI, and rs‐fMRI yielded higher
                          brain age prediction accuracy than
                          single‐modal features. See <a

                          Alzheimer‘s type is crucial to detect areas
                          particularly sensitive to neurodegeneration

                          a large number of imaging features, we
                          incorporate penalization in multi-state Markov

                          In another project, we used multimodal
                          magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images (i.e.,
                          T1-w, T2-w, PD-w, and FLAIR) to detect
                          multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. Accurate
                          identification of MS lesions is essential for
                          MS diagnosis, assessment of disease
                          progression, and evaluation of treatment
                          efficacy. However, it is a challenging task
                          due to the variability in lesion location,
                          size and shape in addition to anatomical
                          variability between subjects. In this work, we
                          developed an integrative classification model
                          that incorporates information from different

                          <br>
                          Brain age prediction based on imaging data and
                          machine learning (ML) methods has great
                          potential to provide insights into the
                          development of cognition and mental disorders.
                          Using machine learning (ML) methods, an age
                          prediction model is first built with brain
                          imaging features from a training data set and
                          then applied to estimate the age of new
                          individuals in an independent test set. The
                          predicted age based on brain imaging data is
                          often referred to as brain age. The difference
                          between predicted age and chronological age is
                          considered as the brain age gap, which is
                          helpful for quantifying delayed or advanced
                          development for youth as well as accelerated
                          or slowed aging for elderly people.<br>
                          <br>
                          In several projects, we investigated brain age
                          prediction with different ML models and brain
                          features from multiple imaging modalities. As
                          the true brain age is unknown and may deviate
                          from chronological age, we further examine
                          whether various levels of behavioral
                          performance across subjects predict their
                          brain age estimated from neuroimaging data.
                          This is an important step to quantify the
                          practical implication of brain age prediction.
                          Our findings are helpful to advance the
                          practice of optimizing different analytic
                          methodologies in brain age prediction. In
                          addition, we applied the proposed brain age
                          prediction model to a group of adolescents
                          with anxiety disorders and tested whether
                          patients with anxiety disorders showed altered
                          brain development compared to healthy
                          controls. See <a

                          Recent advances in human neuroimaging have
                          shown that it is possible to accurately decode
                          how the brain perceives information based only
                          on non-invasive function magnetic resonance
                          imaging (fMRI) measurements of brain activity.
                          Two common statistical approaches include
                          univariate analysis and multivariate pattern
                          analysis (MVPA).<br>
                          <br>
                          In one of our projects, we investigated the
                          representation and processing of auditory
                          categories within the human temporal cortex
                          using high resolution fMRI and MVPA methods.
                          More importantly, we considered decoding
                          multiple sound categories simultaneously
                          through multi-class support vector
                          machine-recursive feature elimination
                          (MSVM-RFE) as our MVPA tool. Results show that
                          the model MSVM-RFE was able to learn the
                          functional relation between the multiple sound
                          categories and the corresponding evoked
                          spatial patterns for both within-subject and
                          across-subject classifications. See <a

                          Random field theory (RFT) provided a
                          theoretical foundation for
                          cluster-extent-based thresholding, the most
                          widely used method for multiple comparison
                          correction of statistical maps in neuroimaging
                          research. However, several studies questioned
                          the validity of the standard clusterwise
                          inference in fMRI analyses and observed
                          inflated false positive rates. <br>
                          <br>
                          In particular, Eklund et al. used
                          resting-state fMRI as null data and found
                          false positive rates of up to 70%, which
                          immediately led to many discussions. In one of
                          our projects, we summarized the assumptions in
                          RFT clusterwise inference and proposed new
                          parametric ways to approximate the
                          distribution of the cluster size by properly
                          combining the limiting distribution of the
                          cluster size given by Nosko and the expected
                          value of the cluster size provided by Friston
                          et al.. We evaluated our proposed method using
                          four different classic simulation settings in
                          published papers. Results show that our method
                          produces a more stringent estimation of
                          cluster extent size, which leads to a better
                          control of false positive rates. Click <a

                          The integrated measurement of diet, physical
                          activity, and the built environment is another
                          important application of big data integration.
                          Recent advances in wearable computing through
                          the use of accelerometers, smartphones, and
                          other devices for tracking individuals and
                          individual behavior, have created a rich
                          opportunity for the integrated measurement of
                          environmental context and behavior. For
                          example, combined GPS and accelerometer units
                          can be used to measure both intensity of
                          physical activity and the setting in which
                          this activity occurred.<br>

                          As the amount of data being generated is
                          exploding, we have entered the era of Big
                          Data. To the extent that data can be analyzed,
                          we may be able to gain a completely new
                          perspective on our world, on how people
                          interact, spend their resources, and organize
                          their time. Data mining involves using
                          algorithms and experience to extract patterns
                          that are either very complex, difficult or
                          time consuming to identify. In contrast to
                          traditional hypothesis-driven approaches to
                          analysis, data mining techniques enables
                          researchers to assess the predictive value of
                          all possible combinations of variables in a
                          data set. Data mining has emerged in recent
                          years as a major area of statistical research
                          and practice and is increasingly employed by

                          In traditional statistical analysis, we assume
                          many observations and a few, well-chosen
                          variables.&nbsp; The trend today is towards
                          more observations but even more so, to much
                          larger number of variables. If the number of
                          variables can greatly exceed the number of
                          observations, we call this type of data
                          high-dimensional data. High dimensionality
                          brings noise accumulation, spurious
                          correlations and incidental homogeneity. The
                          complexity and high dimensionality of data
                          pose great challenges and difficulties for

                          Over the past few years, significant
                          developments have been made in
                          high-dimensional data analysis, driven
                          primarily by a broad range of applications in
                          many fields such as neuroimaging, genomics,
                          and social network data. In our lab, we have
                          been focused on areas of feature selection,
                          classification, regression and dimension
                          reduction. For example, we developed feature
                          selection and classification strategies for

                        hypothesis is updated based on Bayes’ theorem as
                        more information becomes available. A key
                        element of the Bayesian inference is to treat
                        parameters as random variables instead of fixed
                        constants. This approach requires a prior
                        distribution for each unknown parameters whose
                        distribution is updated as a posterior
                        distribution. Bayesian analysis provides a
                        natural and principal way of combining prior
                        information with data. In addition, it provides
                        a flexible setting for a wide range of models
                        such as hierarchical models. <br>

                        In one of our projects, we developed a Bayesian
                        spatially varying coefficient model to
                        incorporate spatial information among brain
                        voxels for fMRI data. By incoroporating the
                        spatial prior information, our approach is shown
                        to be effective in identifying the truly
                        localized patterns of the voxels while
                        maintaining robustness to discover truly
                        distributed pattern. Click <a

                        Since I joined the Psychology department at
                        Drexel, I have been actively involved in several
                        NIH funded projects on assessment of novel
                        interventions for weight loss and maintenance. I

                        weight loss maintenance using multilevel

                        acceptance-based factors for weight loss
                        maintenance, and a mobile intervention for
